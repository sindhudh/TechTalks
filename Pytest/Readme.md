pytest is a popular testing framework for Python that simplifies writing and running tests. It is important because it provides a simple syntax for test cases, supports fixtures for setup and teardown, and includes powerful features like automatic test discovery, parameterized tests, and detailed reporting. Its flexibility and ease of use make it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers, promoting better test coverage, faster feedback, and higher code quality.

Steps:
1. Start By creting New Virtual Environment python -m env venv
2. Activate the Virtaul Environment source env/bin/activate
2. Install Pytest PiP Install Pytest
Creating a virtual environment in Python is important for several reasons:

Isolation of Dependencies: Virtual environments allow you to create isolated environments for each project, preventing conflicts between different versions of libraries or dependencies used in various projects.

Avoid Global Installation: By using a virtual environment, you don't need to install packages globally on your system, which helps avoid cluttering the global Python environment and reduces the risk of versioning issues.

Reproducibility: With a virtual environment, you can specify and control exactly which dependencies and versions are needed for your project. This ensures that others (or your future self) can recreate the environment with all the necessary packages by using a requirements.txt file.

Cleaner Project Structure: Virtual environments keep your project dependencies separate from system-wide packages, leading to a cleaner, more organized development environment.

Easy Collaboration: When collaborating with others, you can share the virtual environment setup, ensuring everyone is working with the same dependencies and versions, which helps avoid "it works on my machine" issues.
